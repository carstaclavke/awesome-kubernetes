For us, as developers, it helps us build on our predecessor developers knowledge. It helps us learn from their mistakes, from their paths, from their experiences: their knowledge. It helps us achieve higher grounds by standing on the shoulders of giants!

Writing these posts forced me to read and reason a lot about all these subjects and helped me understand the techniques used today in software development and I hope these posts are helpful to more fellow developers.
 
Hey Herberto!
A massive thank you for this incredible work. It has provided immense value to me and im inspired to give a talk in my company wrt your topics (ofcourse I will give credit to you) ?
It appears you have stopped adding to the chronicles series since mid 2019 and post #20 onwards is pending.
Do you intend on continuing this or have closed this chapter?
 
Hi Herberto,
First of all, please let me give an apology (later than never, haha!! ) you for re-pulishing and translating your posts to Vietnamese without your permission. But your series are owesome and I would like to ask is there any problem if I continue sharing your post (in Vietnamese) in my site? [?]

Your blog is a great place to embrace with architectural patterns and explore in details having a general understanding and implications from previous posts (up to 16). Thank you a lot for your effort and time.
 
It chronicles the time ye olde Gentleman Cartoonist was an impersonator of the King of Pop in high school, circa 1984. Part comedy, part horror story, part coming-of-age memoir, it is the comix version of the cringe-lit genre of storytelling.
 
Amidst waves of economic crises, health crises, class struggle and neo-fascist reaction, few possess the clarity and foresight of world-renowned theorist, David Harvey. Since the publication of his bestselling A Brief History of Neoliberalism, Harvey has been tracking the evolution of the capitalist system as well as tides of radical opposition rising against it. In The Anti-Capitalist Chronicles, Harvey introduces new ways of understanding the crisis of global capitalism and the struggles for a better world.
 
While accounting for violence and disaster, Harvey also chronicles hope and possibility. By way of conversations about neoliberalism, capitalism, globalization, the environment, technology, social movements and crises like COVID-19, he outlines, with characteristic brilliance, how socialist alternatives are being imagined under very difficult circumstances.
 
In understanding the economic, political and social dimensions of the crisis, Harvey's analysis in The Anti-Capitalist Chronicles will be of strategic importance to anyone wanting to both understand and change the world.
 
**David Harvey** is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

His recent books include Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism (Profile Books, 2014) and The Ways of the World (Profile Books, 2016). He contributed the foreword to the Pluto Press edition of The Communist Manifesto (Pluto, 2008; 2017).
